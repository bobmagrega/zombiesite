<h1>A Zombie Nightmare</h1>
<p>I can't move. What? The whole body aches. With a wheeze in my lungs, I roll over onto my back, and the sun's rays break through the redness of my closed eyelids. I slightly open my eyes, and at the same moment I feel a terrible pain. Unable to bear it, I close my eyes again. So I managed to hold out until the morning, what luck! I ran away from them at midnight on rooftops, down alleys, and down the fire escape ... Ah, that's the point. She could not bear the weight and collapsed. But where are they then? Hell, every movement in the body responds with sharp pricks. After lying down for a few more minutes, I still get up, grabbing the mesh fence. Exactly six bodies lie in front of me in the alley in which I found myself after a nightmare came true. That's how many tried to devour me, but failed. Thoughts swirl in my head, trying to fit into the whole picture, it adds up, but it is so absurd that it falls apart again. Everything is as it is on TV. Like a thousand games I've played. The zombie apocalypse has come. Real fucking zombie apocalypse. I silently look at the corpses in front of me for a few more moments, the pain ceases to be so strong, allowing me to take a few steps to the iron pipe and the lantern near one of the bodies. I know what is about to happen now. As soon as I reach out to the pipe, this creature grabs me. Looking around, I noticed a canister near the back entrance to a residential building, went up to it and kicked it. Complete. I raise it above my head, in two steps I reach the corpse, next to which my things lie, and I bring down the canister on his head. No powerful fountains from the brain, just a crunch, the canister falls on its side, covering the broken head. I quickly grab my things and leave the alley. My god ... How many of them. The whole street is packed with them. They groan, walk around the bush, vomit under themselves, fight among themselves, tear some body to pieces and devour its insides. But I am not disgusted, no matter how wild it sounds, all this is already visible. The only question is: how to get around them? It is necessary to go to the height. Looking around, I notice a bright white arrow above the car, drawn in chalk on the wall, pointing up. The car stands perpendicular to the facade of a residential building, in the alley of which there are several dead dead. Indeed, if you climb onto that car, reach the window sill along it and jump onto the balcony from it, you can get inside. With pains and moans, I manage to throw my exhausted body over the balcony railing. Lying on the floor, I catch my breath and again try to comprehend what is happening. Well, this cannot be! Anything, war, genocide, the end of the world, aliens ... But the dead! For the last two years, only films have been made about them! And then it occurs to me ... Maybe they tried to warn? And then a more meaningful thought comes in: How far has it gone? One city? Country? Peace? My parents ... They live in Moscow, are they alive? Or maybe it all started here, in St. Petersburg, and they are already preparing barricades and food rationing? All then, you have to move. I get up, open the unlocked balcony door and go inside. The first thing I do is stumble over something, catching my balance back, I turn around sharply, clutching a short iron pipe in my hand. A man is lying on the floor. Dead. It’s dead. Next to him lies a pistol and one empty cartridge case, and he himself has been shot through the skull. I take the pistol, pull out the magazine. 6 shots. Not bad, better than a pipe. I left the apartment. The entrance is covered with various inscriptions that say about punishment for our sins, that someone besides me has already seen all this on a computer monitor, I especially liked this one: "I killed 53,475." And just below it is signed: "Yap!". Slowly I begin to move upward. When I reach the door to the roof, I notice that it is covered in bloody scratches, bits of nails lie at the door, bloody spots cover the walls nearby. I push the door, but it seems to be supported by something. Having piled on with all my strength, I open it wide open and go out onto the roof. She was propped up by another body with a bite on her left forearm. Looks like he died recently. A faint smile crosses my face.</p>
